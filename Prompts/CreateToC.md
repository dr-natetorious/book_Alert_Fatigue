Create a table of contents (ToC) for our book. I’m the target audience an expert software enginer that needs to create an alert fatigue and management system that scales to realistic size (eg 2500 servers farm).

The tech stack will be fastapi, server side render of jinga 2 templates with html5, bootstrap, vanilla JS. SQLModel with SQLite and fiaas vector database. I have lots of books covering these aspects keep it to a minimum (e.g., reference code in a github and output project structure NOT bunch of CSS/html. I'll FUCKING KILL YOU if you output a bunch of CSS/HTML)

Everything must run in proc and the prototype must support typical day (9-5) has 10k alerts. When things break there are spikes of 1k . 

An alert has standard server properties (host, time, instance, status) and message (255 chars).

Let’s focus each chapter on a solution-based approach to learning the relevant concepts. You’ll output the table of contents and then I’ll request specific subsections be rendered where useful.

for example, I need to populate the setup with historical data from a common dataware house (e.g., clickhouse) and demonstrate its accuracy.

The first poc is mapping clusters to historical slack threads (metadata). Our warehouse has a column on each historical alert where discussed (sparsely populated)

Our performance SLO is realtime monitoring using a modern operational architecture (e.g., streaming web sockets to python 3.13 daemon with web UI).

Follow these instructions to produce the final result:
1. Output the ToC into an the first artifact.
2. Stop and think about it. Why is this generic shit? How can you focus more on the problem -- alerting fatigue and vector clustering. Output your evaluation of step-1

3. Next can you outline the learning objectives for each chapter? a. A great book teaches how to fish not talks about fish. b. We should have a concert solution that’s progressively enhanced across chapter. c. i.
There needs to be a through line that connects the chapter from start to end. ii. At same time the chapters within each part must progrsssivlt build on each other. iii. Likewise another macro arc must connect the entire TOC start to end. d. Ensure there's a working demo available at the end of each chapter.

Rewrite the TOC to address these issues as a third artifact
4. Perform a web search and validate the plan from step-3 (e.g., is it modern and technically fesible? anything overengineered or under developed?). Use this information to a. Update the artifact from step-3 where corrections are needed b. Insert citations to web results within the ToC so its externally verifiable. d. I'll FUCKING KILL YOU if you make up a citation

5. Cycle back to step-2 at least twice to produce the best final result. Thanks!
