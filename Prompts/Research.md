Can you draft chapter  10? 

I don’t care about the fastapi and sql parts keep that bare minimal. Use the project knowledge for requirements of conversational voice and technical audience. Don’t create a bunch of web content . Just say it’s in git hub and include the projrct folder structure. First do a web search and research all details, best practices, etc. Output the research into an artifact. 

Ensure you follow the technical and statistical requirements defined in project knowledge. There’s also a a KnownIssues folder within the KB that covers issues from similar itrations.

When you've finished stop and think about this and create the first draft of the chapter using a second artifact.
