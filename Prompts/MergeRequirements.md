Let's start by addressing the big stuff that needs clarification and then we'll get into the less important details.

Context:

I use the book analogy everywhere so we can partition the conversation into logical chunks and regenerate targeted sections. It would be too expensive to render the entire book 100x and the content would exceed any memory buffer (and cost too much)

First, the objective of this book is "teaching how to fish, not talking about fish." By the end of this book it will have covered what an expert/senior software engineer needs to know to build an AI-enabled alert fatigue system. Specifically, we are approaching this problem by clustering alert text (255 char strings) and resolution notes (slack threads) into known issues and mitigation step.

To accomplish this goal, we're progressively going through a series of connected chapters that build the capabilities, technical depth, and acumen to build the real system.  Think of it as an MVP or constructive research project that cares most about demonstrating that all of the pieces work.

The system needs to be scalable to support 2,500 server farms. We value simplicity and want everything to run within a "single process" on a "production server." This is more than sufficient for our test workload, which receives 10K alerts/day and 1K alerts in 5 minutes in crazy storm scenarios.  

Current State:
So far, we have generated the first draft of the book, requirements, and a set of known issues. The known issues are too strict and the requirements are too lax. We need to calibrate a balance across these artifacts. Really, this is going to be read by me and my immediate team (<10 people), not a massive audience. We want it to be enjoyable (eg put a well-placed joke after a tough section). 

The numbers need to be in the ballpark (15MB = 14.62128378MB); we don't care, just round them. However, avoid unsubstantiated claims or sensational language. These projections influence team-level prioritization (e.g., we'll choose an easy 75% vs hard 82% accuracy level).

Next Task:
Given this context let's start by examining what's misrepresented in our requirement guides. Claude and myself need to be on same page or it'll be challenging to continue the second pass of generating "this book." 

Also include a quality control requirement. I'm going to start placing a version date string at the top of each document. When you see conflicting information ALWAYS use the highest version resource. 

That's because we can't regenerate the entire book after ever change (too expensive). This process change will significantly keep the generation process current despite the content being eventual consistent.


Output an artifact that outlines our quality controls...

Great this is perfect. Now let's merge the other requirements documents into this, specifically we'll focus on the good parts (e.g., conversation guide gets into several examples of monontous structures to avoid). 

When the incoming document conflicts, YOU MUST CHALLENGE IT. Assume that your right and ASK for CONFIRMATION that its right. Remember the version checks your version 20250529 -- these are 20250528 documents.

ex:
Leave the page length at 300. This is a technical book not a romance novel -- we still need tables, graphs, flow charts, etc. That'll eat up 50 pages itself.

I like books written by 2-3 authors because they tell the story from different perspectives while being self consistent (e.g., Alice wrote chapter 3, 7, 9 -- she explains things like A, B, C. Bob wrote 2, 8, 10 and explains Z, A, B, Y, Q, C). It's these subtle stylistic changes (e.g., energy levels) that reduces the monotonous language. 

Regardless the total length (100 vs 500 pages); it must not sound like a robot is filling out the template. Give it depth and personality. Engaging conversational and enjoyable
