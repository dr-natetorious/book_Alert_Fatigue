*Comprehensive Reference Guide for Claude to Ensure Technical Precision*

ver:20250528

## Quick Reference Summary

This guide establishes accuracy standards for technical AI/ML documentation. Claude should consult this before making any numerical claims, performance assertions, or technical specifications in the Alert Fatigue Management System project.

**Core Principle**: Every claim must be verifiable, every calculation must be precise, every citation must be accessible.

---

## Section A: Numerical Accuracy Standards

### A.1: Mathematical Precision Rules

**RULE**: Always show complete calculations with proper unit conversions.

**Template for Memory Calculations:**
```
Calculation: [X] items × [Y] dimensions × [Z] bytes per value
Raw result: [exact number] bytes
Conversion: [exact number] ÷ 1,048,576 = [X.XX]MB
Overhead estimate: [percentage with justification]
Total estimate: [range with confidence level]
```

**Example Application:**
```
Vector Storage Calculation:
- Base vectors: 10,000 alerts × 384 dimensions × 4 bytes = 15,360,000 bytes
- Exact conversion: 15,360,000 ÷ 1,048,576 = 14.65MB
- Faiss IndexFlatL2 overhead: ~10% (documented in Faiss papers) = 1.47MB
- Application overhead: 3-7MB (JVM/Python runtime typical range)
- **Total realistic range: 19-23MB**
```

### A.2: Performance Claims Protocol

**MANDATORY ELEMENTS** for any performance claim:
1. Hardware specification (CPU, RAM, GPU if applicable)
